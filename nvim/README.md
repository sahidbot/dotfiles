NyxVim is a Neovim setup powered by [💤 lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
to make it easy to customize and extend your config.
Rather than having to choose between starting from scratch or using a
pre-made distro, NyxVim offers the best of both worlds - the flexibility
to tweak your config as needed, along with the convenience of a pre-configured setup.

## ✨ Features

- 🔥 Transform your Neovim into a full-fledged IDE
- 💤 Easily customize and extend your config with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
- 🚀 Blazingly fast
- 🧹 Sane default settings for options, autocmds, and keymaps
- 📦 Comes with a wealth of plugins pre-configured and ready to use

## ⚡️ Requirements

- Neovim >= **0.8.0** (needs to be built with **LuaJIT**)
- Git >= **2.19.0** (for partial clones support)
- a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) **_(optional)_**
- a **C** compiler for `nvim-treesitter`. See [here](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter#requirements)

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Make a backup of your current Neovim files:

  ```sh
  mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
  mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
  ```

- Clone the starter

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/sahidbot/NyxVim ~/.config/nvim
  ```

- Remove the `.git` folder, so you can add it to your own repo later

  ```sh
  rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git
  ```

- Start Neovim!

  ```sh
  nvim
  ```

## 📂 File Structure

The files under config will be automatically loaded at the appropriate time,
so you don't need to require those files manually.
**NyxVim** comes with a set of default config files that will be loaded
**_before_** your own. See [here](https://github.com/sahidbot/NyxVim/tree/main/lua/nyxvim/config)

You can add your custom plugin specs under `lua/plugins/`. All files there
will be automatically loaded by [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
